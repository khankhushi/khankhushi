I transform complex datasets into actionable insights that drive business strategy. Currently at Deloitte USI, I'm passionate about the intersection of **technology, finance, and design**, leveraging data analytics to uncover financial patterns and shape design-driven business outcomes.

I specialize in Salesforce Data Cloud, audience segmentation, and building analytical dashboards with SQL and Python. My work centers on creating data solutions that bridge technical precision with strategic thinking, enabling enterprises to make informed, impactful choices.

Outside of work, I'm found exploring design principles, learning about emerging technologies, and optimizing workflows. I document my experiments and insights on my personal website.
